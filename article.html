					These AgriSharable Analytics Terms of Service (“Analytics Terms”) apply to our “AgriSharable Analytics” product family.

In the event of a conflict between the Analytics Terms and the Terms of Service, the Analytics Terms control.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="art-box">
				<div class="tt">A. Definitions.</div>
				<div class="con">
					The following defined terms shall apply. All capitalized terms that are not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Service.<br/>
					“AgriSharable Analytics”: any section of our Services (including App Analytics) where users maintain Source Account Information and/or access Collected Data (both terms as defined below). AgriSharable Analytics includes any Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) or other programmatic interfaces for interacting with, or obtaining information from, AgriSharable Analytics.<br/>
					“AgriSharable App”: mobile applications that provide access to AgriSharable Analytics.<br/>
					“Collected Data”: data collected by us by either connecting to the Sources on behalf of our users, or accessing uploaded data (for example, manually entered data, uploaded files) provided by our users. Collected Data does not include public data directly available via the Sources. An example of Collected Data is an iTunes Sales Report.<br/>
					“Source Account Information”: account credentials, such as login and password information, for accessing data from a specific Source (for example, an iTunes Connect user name and password).<br/>
					“Sources”: online third-party data sites, services and sources, which may include, without limitation, Apple iTunes Connect, Google Play and other app stores, as well as digital distribution, analytics, advertising and monetization platforms. Sources may also include third-party products and services that incorporate SDKs (or similar pieces of functionality) provided by AgriSharable.<br/>
					“AgriSharable Intelligence”: the sections of our Services (including AIgro) where subscribers receive estimates of app performance (e.g., downloads, revenues, etc.), including across publishers, industries, geographies and marketplaces.<br/>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="art-box">
				<div class="tt">B. Rights Granted to AgriSharable; Use of Collected Data.</div>
				<div class="con">
					By using AgriSharable Analytics, you expressly authorize us to access and use your Collected Data maintained by the Sources. We will submit your Source Account Information that you provide to us to access to the Sources. Source Account Information is always stored in accordance with our Data Security Policy.<br/>
					For purposes of these Analytics Terms and to provide Collected Data to you as part of AgriSharable Analytics, you grant us a limited power of attorney, and appoint us as your attorney in-fact and agent, to access Sources, store your Source Account Information and retrieve and use your Collected Data with the full power and authority to do and perform each action necessary in connection with such activities, as you could do in person (including configuring AgriSharable Analytics so that it is compatible with the Sources for which you submit your information). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN WE ARE ACCESSING AND RETRIEVING COLLECTED DATA, WE ARE ACTING AS YOUR AGENT, AND NOT AS THE AGENT OF OR ON BEHALF OF A THIRD PARTY.<br/>
					NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT ACTING AS YOUR AGENT IF WE USE YOUR COLLECTED DATA (IN OUR AGRISHARABLE STATISTICAL MODEL) TO GENERATE AND PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF APP PERFORMANCE TO SUBSCRIBERS OF OUR AGRISHARABLE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.<br/>
					Specifically, we may access and include your Collected Data in the pool of data used by our Agrisharable Statistical Model to generate and provide estimates of app performance (e.g., downloads, revenues), including across publishers, industries, geographies and marketplaces, to subscribers of Agrisharable Intelligence. Subscribers to Agrisharable Intelligence never receive your specific set of Collected Data in an identifiable form. You hereby acknowledge and consent to the use of your Collected Data in this manner by using Agrisharable Analytics.<br/>
					FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE ESTIMATES GENERATED BY OUR APP ANNIE STATISTICAL MODEL (AND MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHERS) MAY INCLUDE PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES OF YOUR ASSETS / DIGITAL GOODS / PRODUCTS. These estimates are derived from aggregated pools of information that may include your Collected Data. Because they are generated by our Agrisharable Statistical Model from aggregated pools of information and are only estimates, we consider these estimates regarding your apps to be non-identifiable even though (a) the estimates may be very similar to the actual performance data you provide as part of your Collected Data and (b) the estimates may specifically name each app and publisher.<br/>
					If you have any questions about the foregoing, please contact us at legal@agrisharable.com.<br/>
					Except as described herein, your specific set of Collected Data will not be provided to a third party in an identifiable form without your consent, unless we conclude that it is required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, implement a change of control transaction, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.<br/>
					You understand and agree that Agrisharable Analytics may not be sponsored or endorsed by any third parties accessible through Agrisharable Analytics.<br/>
					In addition to the foregoing, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sub-licensable and transferable right to use your Collected Data for internal purposes to operate and improve our Services (including Agrisharable Intelligence) for you and other customers, and to build and operate new services and products.<br/>
					A limited number of Agrisharable employees (including those of third-party service providers authorized to carry out tasks on our behalf, as described in our Privacy Policy) may log in to Agrisharable Analytics on your account in order to maintain the Services. Employees of Agrisharable are required to sign an Insider Trading Policy agreement and Non-Disclosure Agreement to ensure the privacy of your Collected Data and Source Account Information.<br/>
					Upon your request, we will delete your account and associated account information (such as your contact details, email addresses and Source Account Information). While we will immediately cease any future collection of your Collected Data upon deletion of your account, any Collected Data that has already been included in the pool of data used by our Agrisharable Statistical Model will not be deleted. Additional information on our Deletion practices can be found in our Privacy Policy.<br/>
					You may voluntarily decide to make your Collected Data available to others, through a sharing or similar function if provided by us (“Sharing”). The scope of such Sharing, and with whom, is up to you. You agree that you are responsible for and are authorized to perform any such Sharing and that such Sharing shall be outside of the scope of these Analytics Terms and our Privacy Policy.<br/>
