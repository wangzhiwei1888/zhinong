				<div class="tt">Cookies and Similar Technologies</div>
				<div class="con">
					This Privacy Policy provides you with clear information about cookies and similar technologies and AgriSharable’s purposes for using them (which include, among other things, collecting Technical Information). By continuing to use the Services, you are agreeing to AgriSharable’s use of such technologies on your computer and/or mobile device. If you do not consent to AgriSharable’s use such technologies, you must change the settings on your browser or not use the Services. A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer or mobile device. A cookie allows us to distinguish you from other visitors so that we can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie originated, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value (usually a randomly generated unique number). AgriSharable’s systems may issue cookies as soon as you visit the Sites unless you have adjusted your browser setting to refuse cookies. If you do not want AgriSharable to attach cookies, then you must choose to disable cookies on your browser, which you may do at any time. If you disable cookies on your browser, some parts of the Services may not work fully. We employ technologies such as clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), tags and scripts to help us better manage content by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track online usage metrics. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer or device, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We do tie the information gathered by clear gifs to personally identifiable information. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit page, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to measure users’ activity on the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable. Our Services may include links, features or components supplied by third parties, such as the Facebook “Like” button or other interactive tools. Such third-parties may have information practices different than those set forth herein and their use of cookies and similar technologies is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not have access to or control over such third parties and encourage you to consult the privacy notices provided by those third parties.
